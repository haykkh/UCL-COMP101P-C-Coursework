# UCL COMP101P C Coursework

Using the Engduino to collect data and Processing/C to display the data.

# Instructions

If you're using an Engduino, compile and upload, light_sensor/light_sensor.ino onto your Arduino
If you're using another Arduino device, compile and upload light_sensor__non_engduino_devices_/light_sensor__non_engduino_devices_.ino onto your Arduino

To run the grapher, either download grapher/application.macosx/grapher.app, or download grapher/grapher.pde and run through the Processing IDE.
